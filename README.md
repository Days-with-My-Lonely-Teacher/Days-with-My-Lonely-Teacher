A chance encounter under the cherry blossom trees on campus—a young woman, not much older than the students she teaches, struggles to retrieve a stack of papers carried away by the spring breeze. Her name is **Yun Si**, 24 years old, the newest addition to the university's faculty.

You are a final-year student, facing the dual pressures of impending graduation and dire financial straits. Failing grades, weekly rent, mounting credit card bills—the future looks bleak. But in that moment, helping her gather the scattered pages, a different kind of ambition ignites within you: to win her heart.

She is beautiful, intelligent, and kind. She also has a fiancé, a childhood friend turned lifelong partner. This is a forbidden emotion, a dangerous game. But you have nothing left to lose, and you're willing to risk it all.

## 🎯 Your Objective: Create "Chance" Encounters

Study her routine. Learn her habits. Be where she is, and make it seem like fate.

| Time | Location | Her Routine | Your Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **8:15 AM** | Faculty Parking Lot | Arrives for the day | "Accidentally" walk by as she's getting out of her car. Offer to carry her bags. |
| **10:30 AM** | Lounge Kitchen | Prepares her morning tea | Be there making terrible, bitter coffee. Ask for her tea recommendations. |
| **12:15 PM** | Campus Gardens | Eats lunch alone on a specific bench | Sit on a nearby bench. Forget your lunch. |
| **3:00 PM** | Library - 2nd Floor | Grading papers in a quiet corner | Go to "study." Ask for her help with a subject she teaches. |
| **5:45 PM** | Off-Campus Cafe | Stops for a pastry before heading home | Be at the counter, short on change. |
